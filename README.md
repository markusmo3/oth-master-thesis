Additional files for the Master Thesis at the OTH Regensburg "Comparing the impact of code highlighting schemes during code comprehension using eye-tracking technologies"

# Index
* `data` contains all the captured data in its raw form. Originating either from the surveys or the eye-tracking session.
* `diagrams` includes all images and data generated by the R scripts. The diagrams are in the `.pdf` file format to allow for scaling without loosing quality inside the master thesis written in LaTeX.
* `docs` has the two survey documents that were used in the study.
* `pics` accommodates overview pictures of the four chosen highlighting schemes.
* `src` holds the source code written by me to wrangle the raw data in R and to add the "Random" highlighting scheme to IntelliJ through the use of a groovy [LivePlugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7282-liveplugin).
